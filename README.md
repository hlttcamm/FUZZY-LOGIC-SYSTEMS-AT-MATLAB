# FUZZY LOGIC SYSTEMS AT MATLAB 
 Fuzzy Logic sistems mean a kind of Decesion Provide Program. That is, Fuzzy logic simulaze a expert ideas on about topic and we import from his ideas to our models. Thanks to that, As we don't need to consult him, we reach a decision on topic according to his thoughts. In deed, it is a type of machine learning that expert's data is transported from his mind to machine.
 To perform that, we may use toolbax named Fuzzy Logic at MATLAB. This modelling on MATLAB toolbox, we must enter whole stiutions according to his minds. And all cases should be included. For example, let's think when a bus may arrive in time or late. This stuation is effected by some parameters like a being what time is it, rainny, intensity of passenger etc. As we are modelling, we must enter all situations as data to our model.For instance, 
 
-If weather is ***rainy***, time is ***15:00***......, ***high*** of probability the bus will be late

-If weather is ***sunny***, time is ***11:00*** ......, ***very low*** of probabality the bus will be late

-If...................


 That modelling give us that which at probability the bus will be on time.
